# Free Coding Project

For my free coding project in CS 111 I wanted to build something I'm interested in, so I created a blockchain that is accessible from a Github.io website. Check out the website, look around at my code, and let me know if you see any potential improvements.

You can see this project on [my site](https://hyrumjb.github.io/blockchain).
